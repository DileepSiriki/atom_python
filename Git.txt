VERSION CONTROL SYSYTEMS : Is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work.

  Local Version Control Systems (RCS) : Stores versions of each file separately .
  Centralized Version Control Systems : Depends on a central server , To collaborate with developers on other systems. Single point of failure and database corruptions .
  Distributed Version Control Systems : clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository.
      Thus if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data

GIT :
=====
The major diference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data.
Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes.
These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.

But in GIT gvery time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
To be eficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.
Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.

The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA-1 hash.
This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f)
calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git. A
SHA-1 hash looks something like this: 24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373
Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its contents.

    • Speed and integrity (can not change anything without git knowing about it )
    • Simple design using commands
    • Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
    • Fully distributed
    • Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently

FILE STRUCTURE :
================
GIT DIRECTORY : is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.
This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

WORKING DIRECtory : is a single checkout of one version of the project.
These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify

STAGING AREA : is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
It’s sometimes referred to as the “index”, but it’s also common to refer to it as the staging area

WORKFLOW :
==========
1. You modify files in your working directory.
2. You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.
3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.

If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered committed.
If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And
if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.

$ git config --global user.name "esrkdlp"
$ git config --global user.email dileep.siriki@ericsson.com
$ git config --list -> to list all configuration settings

GIT HELP :

GIT TERMINOLOGIES :
====================
Blobs : Blob stands for Binary Large Object. Each version of a file is represented by blob. A blob holds the file data but doesn’t contain any metadata about the file. It is a binary file, and in Git database, it is named as SHA1 hash of that file. In Git, files are not addressed by names. Everything is content-addressed.
Trees : Tree is an object, which represents a directory. It holds blobs as well as other sub-directories. A tree is a binary file that stores references to blobs and trees which are also named as SHA1 hash of the tree object.
Commits : Commit holds the current state of the repository. A commit is also named by SHA1 hash. You can consider a commit object as a node of the linked list. Every commit object has a pointer to the parent commit object. From a given commit, you can traverse back by looking at the parent pointer to view the history of the commit. If a commit has multiple parent commits, then that particular commit has been created by merging two branches.
Branches : Branches are used to create another line of development. By default, Git has a master branch, which is same as trunk in Subversion. Usually, a branch is created to work on a new feature. Once the feature is completed, it is merged back with the master branch and we delete the branch. Every branch is referenced by HEAD, which points to the latest commit in the branch. Whenever you make a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit.
Tags : Tag assigns a meaningful name with a specific version in the repository. Tags are very similar to branches, but the difference is that tags are immutable. It means, tag is a branch, which nobody intends to modify. Once a tag is created for a particular commit, even if you create a new commit, it will not be updated. Usually, developers create tags for product releases.
Clone : Clone operation creates the instance of the repository. Clone operation not only checks out the working copy, but it also mirrors the complete repository. Users can perform many operations with this local repository. The only time networking gets involved is when the repository instances are being synchronized.
Pull ; Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repository instances. This is same as the update operation in Subversion.
Push : Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one. This is used to store the changes permanently into the Git repository. This is same as the commit operation in Subversion.
HEAD : HEAD is a pointer, which always points to the latest commit in the branch. Whenever you make a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit. The heads of the branches are stored in .git/refs/heads/ directory.

[CentOS]$ ls -1 .git/refs/heads/
master
[CentOS]$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
570837e7d58fa4bccd86cb575d884502188b0c49

Revision : Revision represents the version of the source code. Revisions in Git are represented by commits. These commits are identified by SHA1 secure hashes.
URL : URL represents the location of the Git repository. Git URL is stored in config file.

Tracked files : are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged.
Untracked files : are everything else – any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.
When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything


GIT LOG :
==========
git log           -> show commit history in the current branch
git log --oneline -> single line prints
git log -p        -> To view commit history and also the changes introduced
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" -> (sha -  author name - date - message)

GIT DIFF :
=-=========
git show <commit-ID/SHA> -> to see the changes made
git diff      -> For a tracked file -> To see what you’ve changed but not yet staged.
                 compares what is in your working directory with what is in your staging area.
                 It doesn’t show all changes made since your last commit – only changes that are still unstaged.
git difftool  -> open a GUI session to see changes.
Do a "git log " and 'git show' before pushing , pulling , commiting atc;
Do a 'git pull' before a "git push" to sync the local repository with the remote

GIT Stash :
==============
In Git, the stash operation takes your modified tracked files, stages changes, and saves them on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.
git stash -> to stash the working directory and staged changes
git stash list -> to list all stashes
git stash pop -> execute the git stash pop command, to remove the changes from the stack and place them in the current working directory.

GIT REMOVE/MOVE :
===================
git rm <file> -> deletes from tracked files are and once committed , it is gone from next time . then do commit and push to reflect changes .
git mv <source> <destination> -> To RENAME / MOVE files , once done we need to commit and push the changes to remote
                                 This is equalent to : 1-> mv <source> <destination>
                                                       2-> git rm <source>
                                                       3-> git add <destination>
git push origin --delete <remote-branch> -> Delete a remote branches

GIT RESET :
================
git reset --soft -> just resets the HEAD pointer to previous commit and does not change anything
git reset --mixed -> reverts those changes from the staging area that have not been committed yet. It reverts the changes from the staging area only. The actual changes made to the working copy of the file are unaffected. The default Git reset is equivalent to the git reset -- mixed.
git reset --hard  -> it will clear the staging area; it will reset the HEAD pointer to the latest commit of the specific commit ID and delete the local file changes too.

GIT TAGGING :
================
Tag operation allows giving meaningful names to a specific version in the repository.
git tag -a '<AlIAS>' -m '<Message>' <Commit-Id
Now do : git push origin tag <alias>
git tag -l -> list Tags
git tag -d <alias> -> remove Tags

GIT REMOTE :
===============
git remote add <alias> <url> -> to add remote repository.
git remote -v -> list remote repositories
git remote rm <alias> -> remove remote
git remote rename <old> <new>
Remote branches take the form of (remote)/(branch) as in origin/master

GIT TAGGING :
===============
Git uses two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated.

A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change – it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.
git tag <tag>

Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message
git tag -a <tag> -m "message"

git list               -> list Tags
git show <tag>         -> show info about a tag
git push origin <tag>  -> push a tag to server
git push origin --tags -> push all tags to server
git checkout -b <branch> <tag> -> we cannot checkut to tags but can create a branch and checkout to that branch having data of a tag.

GIT ALIAS :
==============
$ git config --global alias.co checkout -> git co = git checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch   -> git br = git Branch
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.st status

$ git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
$ git last = git log -1 HEAD


GIT COMMIT :
=================
git commit -m "commit message"
git commit --amend -m "<new commit message>" -> to change the previous commit and not create a new commit
gitk -> GUI of Commits

Git doesn’t store data as a series of change sets or differences, but instead as a series of snapshots.
When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged
This object also contains the author’s name and email, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents):
  zero parents for the initial commit, o
  ne parent for a normal commit, and
  multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.

EXAMPLE :
$ git add README test.rb LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'The initial commit of my project'

When you create the commit by running git commit, Git checksums each subdirectory (in this case, just the root project directory) and stores those tree objects in the Git repository.
Git then creates a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create that snapshot when needed.
Your Git repository now contains five objects:
    one blob for the contents of each of your three files,
    one tree that lists the contents of the directory and specifies which file names are stored as which blobs, and
    one commit with the pointer to that root tree and all the commit metadata.

                                                                    5b1d3
INITIAL COMMIT ->                                      blob                        size

GIT BRANCHING :
=================
Branch operation allows creating another line of development.
we can use this operation to fork off the development process into two different directions.
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is MASTER.
As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.

git branch <branch-name> ->  creates a branch
git branch -> list Branches
git checkout <branch-name> ->  move to branch
git checkout -b <branch-name> -> create a branch and move into it.
git branch -m <old> <new> -> Rename a branches
git branch -v -> To see the last commits in all branches
git branch --merged
git branch --no-merged -> check branches not merged as of now

A branch can be deleted by providing –D option with git branch command.
But before deleting the existing branch, switch to the other branch.
git branch -D <branch-name>
git branch -d <branch-name> -> makes sure that a merge is done so that the complete code is available in master
git push origin <branch> -> to push to remote
git push origin --delete <remote-branch> -> Delete a remote branches

In Git, there is a pointer to the local branch you’re currently on -> heads

1. git branch Testing                                             2. git checkout Testing
  (creates a branch pointing to latest commit)                       (HEAD pointer moves to testing branch)

                        HEAD                                                     MASTER
                          |                                                         |
                        MASTER                                23rt56 <- 456tgy <- 7yug8
                          |                                                         |
    23rt56 <- 456tgy <- 7yug8                                                    Testing
                          |                                                         |
                       Testing                                                    HEAD


3. echo "Code is used to test CPP nodes " >> README
   git add .
   git checkout -m "updated README"
   (A new commit moves HEAD and Testing to the new commit , leaving MASTER as it is )

                   MASTER
                     |
23rt56 <- 456tgy <- 7yug8 <- 945gh3
                               |
                            Testing
                               |
                              HEAD

4. git checkout master
   (It’s important to note that when you switch branches in Git, files in your working directory will change.
   If you switch to an older branch, your working directory will be reverted to look like it did the last time you
   committed on that branch)

                     HEAD
                      |
                    MASTER
                      |
23rt56 <- 456tgy <- 7yug8 <- 945gh3
                                |
                             Testing

5. git checkout master
   git merge testing
   git branch -D testing

GIT MERGE :
===============
Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history.
In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. The commands  merge into the current branch.
The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected.

a-b-c-d             a-b-c-d------\_I (new merge commit)
   \e-f-g-h            \g-f-g-h--/

When creating a merge commit Git will attempt to auto magically merge the separate histories for you.
If Git encounters a piece of data that is changed in both histories it will be unable to automatically combine them.
This scenario is a version control conflict and Git will need user intervention to continue.
git merge --abort -> to abort a merge if there are conflicts

  BEFORE DOING A MERGE :
    Execute git status to ensure that HEAD is pointing to the correct merge-receiving branch.
    If needed, execute git checkout to switch to the receiving branch.
    Make sure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes.
    Execute git fetch to pull the latest remote commits.
    Once the fetch is completed ensure the master branch has the latest updates by executing git pull.
    git fetch
    git pull
    git merge <branch>

  Fast-Forward_merge : linear paths and no new commit is generated .
      when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history,
      Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together

  3-way merge : creates a new commit
      Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward,
      Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it.
      This is referred to as a merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent.


  GIT MERGE CONFLICTS : (git mergetool -> GUI tool)
  ======================
  When you encounter a merge conflict, running the git status command shows you which files need to be resolved .
  Once you've identified conflicting sections, you can go in and fix up the merge to your liking.
  When you're ready to finish the merge, all you have to do is run git add on the conflicted file(s) to tell Git they're resolved.
  Then, you run a normal git commit to generate the merge commit.
  Note that merge conflicts will only occur in the event of a 3-way merge. It’s not possible to have conflicting changes in a fast-forward merge


GIT REBASE :
==============
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing
-> rebasing is like saying, “I want to base my changes on what everybody has already done.”
You have two options for integrating your feature into the master branch: merging directly or rebasing and then merging.
    The former option results in a 3-way merge and a merge commit,
    while the latter results in a fast-forward merge and a perfectly linear history.


The Git rebase command is a branch merge command, but the difference is that it modifies the order of commits.

The Git merge command tries to put the commits from other branches on top of the HEAD of the current local branch.
For example, your local branch has commits A−>B−>C−>D and the merge branch has commits A−>B−>X−>Y,
then git merge will convert the current local branch to something like A−>B−>C−>D−>X−>Y

The Git rebase command tries to find out the common ancestor between the current local branch and the merge branch.
It then pushes the commits to the local branch by modifying the order of commits in the current local branch.
For example, if your local branch has commits A−>B−>C−>D and the merge branch has commits A−>B−>X−>Y,
then Git rebase will convert the current local branch to something like A−>B−>X−>Y−>C−>D.
